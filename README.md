## üìö About The Project

This project is a frontend web application designed to replicate the core functionality of a simple trivia game. It presents users with multiple-choice questions fetched from an external API, allows them to select answers, and then reveals their score upon completion.

It served as a practical exercise in building interactive UIs with React, managing component state, and integrating with third-party APIs.

## üöÄ Features

*   Fetches a set of trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database API.
*   Displays questions one by one with multiple-choice answers.
*   Allows users to select their answers.
*   Checks answers and calculates the final score upon submission.
*   Indicates correct and incorrect answers visually.
*   Option to play again with a new set of questions.
